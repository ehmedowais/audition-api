# Audition API

The purpose of this Spring Boot application is to test general knowledge of SpringBoot, Java, Gradle etc. It is created
for hiring needs of our company but can be used for other purposes.

## Overarching expectations & Assessment areas

<pre>
This is not a university test. 
This is meant to be used for job applications and MUST showcase your full skillset. 
<b>As such, PRODUCTION-READY code must be written and submitted. </b> 
</pre>

- clean, easy to understand code
- good code structures
- Proper code encapsulation
- unit tests with minimum 80% coverage.
- A Working application to be submitted.
- Observability. Does the application contain Logging, Tracing and Metrics instrumentation?
- Input validation.
- Proper error handling.
- Ability to use and configure rest template. We allow for half-setup object mapper and rest template
- Not all information in the Application is perfect. It is expected that a person would figure these out and correct.

## Additional Information based on the implementation

This section MUST be completed by applicants. It allows applicants to showcase their view on how an application
can/should be documented.
Applicants can choose to do this in a separate markdown file that needs to be included when the code is committed.

### Application has been completed and tested.

- to build the application please clone the repository or unzip the file and run this command
  ./gradlew clean build
- OpenTelemetry jar is being shipped with application to run the application with traceability. build.gradle has been
  updated with appropriate tasks
  before running the application please run the below docker command to have jaeger/Zipkin running locally <br/>
  docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest <br/>
  This will start jaeger locally now we can run the application with traceability. <br/>
  If we want to run with gradlew please run from project directory ./gradlew bootRun <br/>
  If we want to run as standalone application please run from directory having open telemetry agent <br/>
  java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar <path>/to/application/audition-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <br/>
- Swagger UI has been enabled in project and four endpoints will be available for testing
